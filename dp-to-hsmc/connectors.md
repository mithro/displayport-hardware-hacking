* QTH-090-01-L-D-A 

QTH family connector with three banks. The difference between this connector
and the ASP version is that all pins are populated in bank 1 of the connector.
This difference equates to slightly lower signal integrity in that bank which
typically carries multi-GHz clock-data-recovery signals. It is recommended that
you do not leave the undefined pins in bank 1 floating; ground them or tie them
to power. This connector has 192 physical pins.

This equates to slightly lower signal integrity in that bank which typically
carries multi-GHz clock-data-recovery signals. It is recommended that you do

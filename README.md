This repository contains schematics for working with DisplayPort.

Currently there are three sub-projects;

 * dp-aux-intercept - A board for connecting DisplayPort AUX signals to FPGA
   boards for interception and manipulation.

 * dp-to-pcie - An adapter board for allowing FPGA development boards with
   PCI-Express 4x interfaces to be instead used with DisplayPort.

 * dp-to-hsmc - An expansion board for the Altera HSMC standard supporting up
   to two DisplayPort sinks and two DisplayPort sources.
